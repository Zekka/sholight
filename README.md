# sholight theme #

This is a very light, highly saturated theme based on the four-color palette used in the Sho documentation. Its airy look-and-feel emphasizes the sparse, easy aesthetic of languages like Ruby and Haskell: however, its high-contrast and varied color scheme makes it eyestrain-free.

Use a large font size and your formatting will look presentation-ready.

Whoa! Lot of deprecations. I've just fixed it for Atom 1.0. Look is basically the same.
